## Discipline of Design and analysis of algorithms

This repository have a projects set implemented in the discipline of design and analysis of algorithms.

Here, we find some sorting algorithms, like: [sorting by comparison](Projects/t1_(comparison_sort)) and [linear sorting](Projects/linear_sorting). Some otimization problems, as: [travelling salesman](Projects/travelling_salesman_problem) and [Knapsack](Projects/knapsack_problem). And finally, some algorithms envolving graphs, like [Dijkstra](Projects/dijkstra).

For more information, access each folder on the folder [Projects](Projects). Each folder there, has information about the problem.
